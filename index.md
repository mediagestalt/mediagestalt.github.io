I'm an academic librarian specializing in Research Data and Assessment. My research interests include digital and spatial humanities, data rescue (and reuse), and computational reproducibility.



<!---
I'm passionate about Canadian politics and discourse. My [masters thesis](http://definingprivacy.mediagestalt.com) investigated the Canadian Government's meaning of privacy by digitally analyzing a 60 million word Hansard corpus. Download my [data](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/hansard) and my [code](https://github.com/mediagestalt).
